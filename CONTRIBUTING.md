## Contributions

There’s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.

### Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs.

### Give feedback on issues

We’re always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome.
It’s often good to first create an issue to report a bug or suggest a new
feature before creating a pull request to prevent you from doing unnecessary
work.

## Submitting a pull request

* Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent
  you from doing unnecessary work
* For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
  community for feedback as soon as possible
* New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation
* Don’t include unrelated changes
* Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
  it’s your job to convince us
